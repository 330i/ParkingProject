# Computer Science 3 Project

## Inspiration
I once saw a Top Gear challenge. James May in his Rolls Royce Corniche Fixed Head with Coachwork by H. J. Mulliner Park Ward against Jeremy Clarkson’s Mercedes 600 Grosser. The two were competing for parking spots in the middle of London. After giving up a parking spot because of the pay-by-phone system, this made me wonder. How are people going to find parking spaces right after the pandemic life?

This prompted me to store the idea for a QR Code based parking app. I was initially planning to repurpose the scrapped CRHS Parking App project with my friend Prasann. However, he’s a senior soon to go to university so the idea didn’t flesh out. When this project assignment came along, I brought this idea from my notes.
